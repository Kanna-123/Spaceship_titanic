# Spaceship Titanic Rescue Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with a spacetime anomaly. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze passenger data to make these predictions.

## Instructions to Replicate the Analysis and Model Training
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   	3.	Place the train.csv and test.csv files in the data directory.
	4.	Open the Jupyter Notebook Spaceship_Titanic_Rescue.ipynb.
	5.	Run all cells in the notebook to perform data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
	6.	The notebook will generate a submission.csv file containing the predictions.
